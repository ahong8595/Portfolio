I previously attended the University of Maryland, College Park, receiving two degrees in computer science and biology. Through my previous experiences, I have developed a strong passion for full-stack development, but in my free time, I enjoy travelling, trying new foods, and basketball. Feel free to reach out to me for any questions."
